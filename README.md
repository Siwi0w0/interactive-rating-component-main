## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to use JavaScript to add some basic interactivity for my website. Use "hide"class and JavaScript to switch between pages.

### Continued development

I need to get myself more comfortable with CSS Grid, for I don't feel fully satisfied with the lay out. I'm also going to practice more with JavaScript and learn more about complex interactivity.
